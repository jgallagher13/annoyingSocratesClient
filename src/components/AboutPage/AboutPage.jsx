        <h1>Annoying Socrates</h1>
        <h2>The unexamined life is not worth living - someone annoying</h2>
        <h3>Let your inner Socrates shine with 'Annoying Socrates' - where the quest for wisdom never ends and the journey of intellectual discovery is as enlightening as it is 'annoying'!</h3>
        <p>Designed for students, this platform is your hub for engaging in meaningful philosophical discussions tht encourage intellectual growth and flexibility. Here you can kick start discussions in a uniquely Socratic way. Choose from a variety of thought-provoking quotes to discuss. Dive into the discussion thread where you and your classmates can challenge, question, and debate. The goal isn't simply to summarize the topic or echo your peer's views; its to embrace the spirit of Socrates and explore, provoke, and, yes, sometimes 'annoy' one another with profound questions.</p>
